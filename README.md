# ‚òÅ SkanksAIO - Gloomrot Update
Forked from [phillipsOG](https://github.com/phillipsOG/SkanksAIO) and updated to gloomrot.

A V-Rising mod that connects your server to discord and a webserver plus some extra stuff.
Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/skythebro/SkanksAIO/issues).


## Installation
* Extract and put the **_SkanksAIO_** folder into your `(Vrising Server)\BepInEx\plugins folder.`
* Start the server once to generate the config file and json files.
* Then edit the config in `(Vrising Server)\BepInEx\config` and the Json files in `(Vrising Server)\BepInEx\config\SkanksAIO`
* Be sure to check out the [configurations](#configurations) section for more info on the config and json files.
* The database will generate in `plugins\SkanksAIO\config`
* If you for some reason want to edit the database you'll need [LiteDB.Studio](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB.Studio/releases) and database management knowledge.

## Json file configurations
### Announcements.json
This file contains a list of announcement messages. These messages will randomly or not (<ins>**_AnnounceRandomOrder_**</ins>) be sent every (<ins>**_AnnounceTimer_**</ins> seconds) in the announcement discord channel or default channel (if <ins>**_AnnounceEnabled_**</ins> is true). You can add as many as you want.
 
```json
["Announcement 1","Announcement 2","Announcement 3"]
```

### Markers.json
This file contains a all the marker info for the interactive map. "testMarker" is the name that will show up on the map. Type is an enum. X and Y are the ingame coordinates for the location of the marker.
I recommend using the ingame command to add markers to this file.
```json
{
  "testMarker": {
    "Type": 15,
    "X": 0,
    "Y": 0
  },
  "testMarker2": {
    "Type": 21,
    "X": -100,
    "Y": -100
  }
}
```

### Messages.json
This file contains the default messages for each of the logon/logoff events. They'll get sent to the discord channel when a user connects or disconnects.
- %user% will get replaced with the username of the user that connected/disconnected.
- The newUserOnline and newUserOffline options cannot have %user% because the player won't have a name yet.
- The newUserCreatedCharacter message gets sent when a user finishes character creation.

```json
{
  "online":"%user% is online!", 
  "offline":"%user% has gone offline!",
  "newUserCreatedCharacter":"%user% has finished character creation!",
  "newUserOnline":"A new vampire just joined!",
  "newUserOffline":"A vampire left before finishing character creation"
}
```

### OfflineMessage.json
This file can be filled with custom logoff messages for specific users.
- %user% will be replaced with the username of the user that disconnected.

```json
{
  "CharacterName":"%user% went offline...",
  "CharacterName2":"Where did %user% go? They went offline..."
}
```

### OnlineMessage.json
This file can be filled with custom logon messages for specific users.
- %user% will be replaced with the username of the user that connected.

```json
{
  "CharacterName":"%user% is back baby!",
  "CharacterName2":"The best V rising player: %user% is here!"
}
```

### Vips.json
This file can be filled with steamid64's of VIP users. (Previously known as SkanksAIO.VIPlist.txt, be sure to add the steamid64's to the json instead of the old txt one!)

```json
[
  76561197960000000,
  76561197960000001,
  76561197960000002
]
```

# Video tutorial for setting up discord bot and extra info
- This [Youtube](https://youtu.be/4XswiJ1iUaw) video shows how to create and invite a bot to your server 
- In the **_URL generator_** section make sure you click on `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Read Messages/View Channels` and `Manage Messages`
- Then the only thing you have to do is put your bot token into the config file and get the id's of the channel and the admin server role and put those in the config too.
- Make sure you have discord developer mode _**enabled**_ otherwise you cannot copy any ID's.
- How to copy channel ID:
