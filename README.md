# Video tutorial for setting up discord bot and extra info
- This [Youtube](https://youtu.be/4XswiJ1iUaw) video shows how to create and invite a bot to your server 
- In the **_URL generator_** section make sure you click on `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Read Messages/View Channels` and `Manage Messages`
- Then the only thing you have to do is put your bot token into the config file and get the id's of the channel and the admin server role and put those in the config too.
- Make sure you have discord developer mode _**enabled**_ otherwise you cannot copy any ID's.
